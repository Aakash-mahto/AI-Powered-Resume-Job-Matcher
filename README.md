# AI-Powered Resume Job Matcher

## Project Overview
AI-Powered Resume Job Matcher is a frontend-focused web application designed to help users, especially freshers and early-career professionals, understand which job roles best match their current skills. Choosing the right job role can be confusing at the beginning of a career, and this project aims to simplify that process using artificial intelligence in a user-friendly way.

The application allows users to manually enter their skills through a text area instead of uploading a resume file. Based on the entered skills, the system sends the input to an AI API, which analyzes the information and suggests three relevant job roles. Example job suggestions include roles such as Python Developer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer. The suggested roles are displayed using a clean, card-based layout to ensure clarity, readability, and a smooth user experience.

Although the user interface includes a resume upload section, file upload functionality is not implemented in the current version of the project. This decision was made intentionally to keep the focus on frontend development, AI integration, and handling AI responses on the client side. Backend features such as file parsing and storage are outside the scope of this project and can be added in future enhancements.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated into a frontend application using modern web technologies. It highlights how user input can be captured, processed, and transformed into meaningful job suggestions without relying on complex backend systems. The project also emphasizes clean UI design, responsive layouts, and logical flow from user input to AI-generated output.

This project represents a real-world scenario where frontend developers work closely with AI services to build intelligent applications. It reflects practical problem-solving skills, self-learning ability, and an understanding of how modern frontend applications interact with AI tools while remaining lightweight, scalable, and user-friendly.
